# mnist_classification_using_ANN
The primary goal of this project is to build and train an artificial neural network to accurately classify the digits in the MNIST dataset. The model will be evaluated based on its accuracy and other performance metrics.  Dataset The MNIST dataset includes:  60,000 training images 10,000 testing images. Each image is a 28x28 pixel grid
